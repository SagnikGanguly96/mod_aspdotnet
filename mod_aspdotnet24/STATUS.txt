Sourceforge mod-aspdotnet Project Status: Unknown

Release:

    2.0.0.2006   : released 13 Nov 2006
    2.0.0.2004   : not released
    2.0.0.2002   : not released 
    2.0.0.2000   : released 20 Nov 2004 
                   (as the ASF mod_aspdotnet httpd subproject)

    [Note that 2.x subversion distinguishes between Apache 2.0 and 2.2,
     so a module 2.2.0.2004 corresponds to Apache httpd binary 2.2.x]


PROJECT NOTICE:

  The Apache HTTP Project has retired mod_aspdotnet, and wrowe, with 
  his employer, Covalent Technologies, have reassumed the care and
  feeding of the module at http://sourceforge.net/projects/mod-aspdotnet

  The mod-aspdotnet sourceforge project follows the same essential flow
  and project policies as observed by the Apache HTTP Server Project.
  New contributors are welcomed under the same meritocracy structure.

IMPORTANT NOTICE:

  Build 2006 is likely to be the end-of-the-line for compiling within the
  Visual Studio 2002 (.NET), as Microsoft has substantially changed the
  Visual C++.NET language itself.  The module maintainers and contributors
  are shifting energies to compatibility with the Visual Studio 2005 C++
  language grammer, which disambiguates pointers from references amoung
  many other prefereable changes.  The next version should continue 
  to load .NET 1.0 or 1.1 hosted applications, we hope.


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:



CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:

    * May fail to run on WIN9x (98, ME).  WINNT (2k, XP, 2003) is required
      by the ApplicationHost.CreateApplicationHost method, see .NET docs
      and http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=32863
      [Users report some success on 98/ME, but the module maintainers will
      continue to deliberately ignore this and leave it to users to determine
      if it's possible in their specific case.]

    * May not recover gracefully after a System.Web.Host is lost, see
      http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=32658 for discussion.

    * Supports both Apache 2.0.x or 2.2.x (use Release 2.2/Debug 2.2
      project configurations with the APACHE22_PATH environment variable
      pointing at the installed Apache 2.2 root)

    * Supports Microsoft's ASP.NET / .NET Runtime v2.0
