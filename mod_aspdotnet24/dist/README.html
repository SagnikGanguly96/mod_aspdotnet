<p>mod_aspdotnet is a module from the 
<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/cli/">cli subproject</a> for the Apache
HTTP Server 2.0.44 or later running on Windows NT Service Pack 6 or later 
(including 2000, 2003, and XP) with the .NET Framework 1.1 (or 1.0).  
It is not known to work on non-Windows platforms, with earlier versions 
of Apache, or 2.0 and later versions of the .NET framework.  Consult the 
project's pages for more details.</p>  

<p>mod_aspdotnet is available as an .msi for you to get running out of
the box. Simply ensure you have installed Apache HTTP Server 2.0 first,
and the Microsoft .NET Framework, before you attempt to install it.</p>

<p>The -src.zip files contain the sources of this module.  It is not
trivial to build and run without a bit of understanding, it is much
easier for most users to simply install the .msi.  Note that at present,
it can only be built under Microsoft Visual Studio .NET, and not the later
2003 or (preview) 2005 Studio products, due to major changes in the way
that C++.NET files are parsed.  If you want to proceed to build your own,
please be our guest, you are well on your way to helping contribute to the 
httpd-cli subproject!</p>
