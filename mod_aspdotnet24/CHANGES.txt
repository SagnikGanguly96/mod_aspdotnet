Changes to mod_aspdotnet SourceForge build 2199

  Replaced the use of regasm and gacutil with tlbexp due to Windows 2008
  UAC restrictions on end users/developers.  Confirmed to build for 2008
  under Visual Studio 2008 (version 9.0) and .NET 2.0, and also confirmed
  compatible with x86_64 bit builds of Apache 2.2 (requires a 64 bit
  installation of .NET to be installed and activated).

  MAJOR: Update solution files and C++.NET source syntax to Visual 
  Studio 2005 (version 8.0), and .NET 2.0.

Changes to mod-aspdotnet SourceForge project build 2006

  Rebrand the project to SourceForge sponsored by Covalent, from the
  ASF branding (no longer an ASF effort, due to the small number of
  active module developers.)

Changes to Apache mod_aspdotnet build 2004

  MAJOR: Changed the preferred thread model to COINIT_MULTITHREADED, only
  falling back on STA CoInitialize() if the original CoInitializeEx fails.

Changes to Apache mod_aspdotnet build 2002

  Corrected Request::GetProtocol() to return "HTTPS" for SSL requests.
  [Will Rowe]

  Fixed error logging (including debug) behavior; pass the server context
  (rather than NULL) to ap_log_error.  [Will Rowe]

  Add AspNetVersion directive to load a specific .NET Framework version.
  [Will Rowe]

  Correct case-sensitivity to request and response headers.  Lower case
  and other less-common header formats will now be recognized as members
  of the ASP.NET defined set of http headers.  Fixes bug 32902 and fixes
  compliance to RFC 2616.  [Will Rowe]

  Apache.Web.dll is NOT Windows 98/ME compatible.  Enabled mod_aspdotnet
  for non-Unicode Windows to permit developers to work twords a solution.
  Partially addresses bug 32863.  [Will Rowe]

  Modify mod_aspdotnet to build under Apache 2.1-dev; fixed brigade
  processing for both httpd-2.0 and httpd-2.1-dev.  Added targets to
  build against 2.1/2.2 using unique project configurations. 
  [Will Rowe]

  Fix the truncation logic for removing a trailing backlash from the
  physical path (file system path) in AspNetMount'ed hosts.

Changes to Apache mod_aspdotnet build 2000

  Allocate the iterator used to review our AspNetMount entries from 
  the request pool, not the configuration pool.
  [Larry Toppi <larry.toppi citrix.com>]

  Added .rc VERSIONINFO tags to query the version of the mod_aspdotnet.so
  and Apache.Web.dll files.  [Will Rowe]

  Release com objects immediately after querying for an interface,
  before we error out that we failed to retrieve an interface.
  [<hammet <hammett uol.com.br>]

  Don't test for a specific httpd.exe or apache.exe binary name, and
  use the correct public key token for loading the Apache.Web assembly
